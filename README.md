# Screenshots
![Shot 1](https://github.com/mediaexplorer74/InteropTools/blob/master/shot1.png)


# Requirenments

Win SDK : 15063

Universal Platform upgraded from 6.0.5 to 6.0.8  

Targets: ARM; x86; x64

# "Workbench" 

Visual Studio 2022 Preview 4

# Refactoring tips:

'Debug' build node is fixed . Maybe, 'Release' too. Don't use StoreDebug or StoreRelease, it's for MS Store deploying..

# Contribute!
There's still a TON of things missing from this proof-of-concept (MVP) and areas of improvement which I just haven't had the time to get to yet.
- Device Unlock Improvements (for HTC phones, for example)
- Additional Packages...
- Media Support: screenshots, etc. (for the brave)

# Solution Layout
Projects have a README.MD which expands on the internal functionality and layout of that project. 


There are no DOCs which explains miscellaneous functionality yet... sorry! =)

With best wishes,

  [m][e] 2021
